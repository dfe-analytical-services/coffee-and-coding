# Coffee & Coding: SQL/Excel to R - How to Make the Jump

#### **David Sands**
#### **2018/11/21**

In this session, DfE analyst David Sands (*moi*) will show y'all how to transition working with SQL and Excel, to working in R. Specifically, I'll demonstrate simple and painless ways to:

 * Connect SQL to R
 * Pull SQL data into R
 * Replace SQL statements using dplyr commands
 * Replace presentation of data in Excel with [DataTables](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/)
 * Replace Excel charts with ggplot charts
 
 This talk is geared (like a stick) toward analysts who see R, say to themselves, `Here, that looks class`, but then have a flush of self-doubt, `Aargh, but it looks so complicated! How am I going to learn R?!`. 
 By showing you how to replace bread-and-butter SQL statements in R, you can start spending more time with it by deploying your data querying in it, presenting your data in it, and visualising your data in it.
