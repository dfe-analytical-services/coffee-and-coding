# Coffee & Coding: SQL/Excel to R - How to Make the Jump

#### **David Sands**
#### **30/01/2019**

In this session, DfE analyst David Sands (*moi*) will show y'all how to transition working with SQL and Excel, to working in R. Specifically, I'll demonstrate simple and painless ways to:

 * Connect SQL to R
 * Pull SQL data into R
 * Replace SQL statements using dplyr commands
 * Replace presentation of data in Excel with [DataTables](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/)
 
 This talk is geared (like a stick) toward analysts who see R, say to themselves, `Here, that looks class`, but then have a flush of self-doubt, `Aargh, but it looks so complicated! How am I going to learn R?!`. 
 By showing you how to replace bread-and-butter SQL statements in R, you can start spending more time with it by deploying your data querying in it.
