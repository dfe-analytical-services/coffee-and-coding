It is I - `The Machine!`

In this session, I will talk about Govdown, and how to customise RMarkdown with the GOV.UK Design System.  I'll demo the new govdown package for rendering documents and websites to use accessible components from the GOV.UK Design System, and show a little of how RMarkdown works under the hood.
