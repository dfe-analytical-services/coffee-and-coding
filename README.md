# Coffee & Coding
### _2019/05/08_

This public repository holds the content of Coffee & Coding sessions held at the Department for Education (DfE).

### What is _Coffee and Coding_?

Coffee & Coding is a chance to learn about and discuss coding tools and techniques with guest presenters (coffee optional, but, just between you and me... `Tea's better`). 

Please contact coffee.coding@education.gov.uk if you: 
  * would like to sign up to the mailing list;
  * have an idea for a session; or
  * or would like to volunteer to lead a session.

### Contributing 
Emulating the [Department for Transport's (DfT)](https://github.com/departmentfortransport/coffee-and-coding) sensible approach - and to induce standardisation across the different Coffee and Coding programs across UK Government Departments - folders should adhere to the following conventions:

* `YYYYMMDD_Topic_Name`
* All folders should contain a `README.md` with notes or a brief explanation about the session of that folder

2017/03/31 | Introduction to the tidyverse | [Matthew Dray](https://github.com/matt-dray) | Heard about the 'tidyverse' in R but don't know what it is? Matt Dray will tell you more about the tidy style and how the tidyverse packages might make your life easier.
2017/04/12 | Mapping in R: choropleths | [Isi Avbulimen](https://github.com/isi-avbulimen) | Limited experience in R but want to create something that looks quite nice? This talk will demonstrate how easy it is to create simple choropleth and Voronoi maps in R.
2017/04/26 | Shiny app | [Matthew Gregory](https://github.com/mammykins) | Got an app idea? Here we demonstrate a sensible workflow for building a Shiny app. We use an interactive mapping app as an example.
2019/02/20 | Gooey Git | [David Sands](https://github.com/PsySandsy) | In this session, David Sands (_moi_), will demonstrate how to Git it on without a command-line. RStudio provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Git. Git is an astounding version control system that allows your code to be auditable, explanatory, and reproducible. This session will cover how to use this GUI to: commit your code; explore the commit history of other projects; create branches; and, merge those branches together All in the comfort of a cosy R Project in RStudio
2019/04/17 | Knitting Machines | [Duncan Garmonsway](https://github.com/nacnudus) | In this session, I - `The Machine` - will talk about Govdown, and how to customise RMarkdown with the GOV.UK Design System.  I'll demo the new govdown package for rendering documents and websites to use accessible components from the GOV.UK Design System, and show a little of how RMarkdown works under the hood. 
2019/05/01 | Reproducible Analytical Pipeline in Action | Jose Orjales | In this session, Dr Jose Orjales will sprinkle some Spanish spice on a proof of concept (POC) Reproducible Analytical Pipeline. He will use Shadow Measures data - used to show the reforms applied to the 16-19 school and college accountability system in 2016 â€“ to demonstrate how a RAP can be deployed via writing functions.   
2019/05/15 | Learn how to learn R in R | [Matthew Dray](https://github.com/matt-dray) | You can learn R interactively with [the {swirl} package](http://swirlstats.com/), which prompts you with questions from within R's console. You can install [a variety of Swirl courses](http://swirlstats.com/scn/) to learn about anything from basic R to more advanced statistical methods. You can also create and share your own Swirl courses, which is made easier with [the {swirlify} package](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/). I'll show you how to do this.
