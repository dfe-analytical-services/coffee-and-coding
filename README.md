# Coffee & Coding
### _2019/05/08_

This public repository holds the content of Coffee & Coding sessions held at the Department for Education (DfE).

### What is _Coffee and Coding_?

Coffee & Coding is a chance to learn about and discuss coding tools and techniques with guest presenters (coffee optional, but, just between you and me... `Tea's better`). 

Please contact coffee.coding@education.gov.uk if you: 
  * would like to sign up to the mailing list;
  * have an idea for a session; or
  * or would like to volunteer to lead a session.

### Contributing 
Emulating the [Department for Transport's (DfT)](https://github.com/departmentfortransport/coffee-and-coding) sensible approach - and to induce standaridasation acorss the different Coffee and Coding programs across UK Government Departments - folders should adhere to the following conventions:

* `YYYYMMDD_Topic_Name`
* All folders should contain a `README.md` with notes or a brief explanation about the session of that folder
