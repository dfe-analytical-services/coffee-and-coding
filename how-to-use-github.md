# How to use Github

### _David Sands_

Github is an online repository(repo) where programmers^[which we believe is _anyone_ who writes code] place their code. Programmers can then easily share their code with the world, and allow other programmers to take their code and adapt it. It is an example of the [open source software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source-software_movement), which is `software in which the source code is freely available for others to view, amend, and adapt`^[http://www.infotoday.com/it/oct01/poynder.htm]. 

At DfE's Coffee and Coding, we are moving to host non-Official Sensitive materials on Github. To help programmers upload their materials to our repo, we have prepared this how to guide on how you can contribute to our repo.

## Creating a Github account

Go to the [Github homepage](https://github.com), and click on _Sign up_. Then enter your details. 

When creating your password, use a password manager like [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) or [MacPass](https://macpassapp.org/) to make it. These create and hold all the passwords of your web accounts in one, safe, encrypted place. This will also be useful when you turn 2FA on...

## Turning 2FA on

Now that you have created your Github account, turn on 2 factor authentication (2FA). This creats an additional code which you enter - with your username and password - to access your Github account. 

Go to your [secuity settings](https://github.com/settings/security).
