# Coffee & Coding: No(-more-)SQL: An applied alternative way to structuring and storing data

#### **Avision Ho**
#### **2019/06/26**

In a no(n)-sequel to a session delivered by former DfE-r, Callum Staff, on hierarchical data formats, Avision Ho will go through why you would use a NoSQL database over a SQL database, how you can set up your own one (for free!) and interrogate it within Python.

The materials for this session are available on Avision's [Github page.](https://github.com/avisionh/nosql-mongodb/tree/feature/jupyter-notebook)
