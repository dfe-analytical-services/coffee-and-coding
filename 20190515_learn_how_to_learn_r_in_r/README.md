# Learn how to learn R in R

A purposefully confusing title. Perhaps 'Create R learning materials with {swirlify}' is better.

## Blurb

>You can learn R interactively with [the {swirl} package](http://swirlstats.com/), which prompts you with questions from within R's console. You can install [a variety of Swirl courses](http://swirlstats.com/scn/) to learn about anything from basic R to more advanced statistical methods. You can also create and share your own Swirl courses, which is made easier with [the {swirlify} package](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/). I'll show you how to do this.

## Lesson plan

I'm going to walk through the ['Teach a person to Swirl'](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/05/10/swirlify/) blogpost and live demo Swirl and Swirlify.

See `session-notes.md` for a rough structure.

## Your homework

1. Beginners: try Swirl if you want to learn some R
2. Everyone else: create a Swirl course with Swirlify
