# Reproducible Analytical Pipeline in Action
### 2019/05/01

You’ve probably all heard or are part of the current drive to create reproducible pipelines within the department. Some of you might be very familiar with them, others of you just using methods and ideas from them as part of your regular work.
A little bit prior to Christmas, I started working on putting together a proof of concept within my team based on a presentation of our shadow measures reforms _aaaages_ ago, with the goal being partly to upskill myself and apply more efficient ways of working in R. I also wanted to act as a bit of a pathfinder to experiment how I could join all these ideas I’d heard in various coffee and coding sessions about projects, functions, connecting to SQL etc would work, in such a way that someone coming at the work fresh would be able to generate everything I had done (or with a new dataset) within minutes.
This proof of concept joins together many of the concepts you’ve heard about previously in a logical approach, going from setting out a project workflow structure all the way through to outputting a final presentation file.
